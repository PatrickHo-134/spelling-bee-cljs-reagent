# Spelling-bee

This is a remade version of [New York Times' spelling bee game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) using Clojurescript, Reagent and Re-frame.

You can check out this [link](https://patrickho-134.github.io/spelling-bee-cljs-reagent/) to see the final product of this project.

## Overview

This project is part of my Clojure training program and used for demonstrating some important concepts in Clojurescript, Reagent and Re-frame.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein clean
    lein fig:min
