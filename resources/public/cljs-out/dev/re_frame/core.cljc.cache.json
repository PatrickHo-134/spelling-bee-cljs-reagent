The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change.

And, at that time, re-frame\n  needs to know how to create the node.   By calling `reg-sub`, you are registering\n  'the template' or 'the mechanism' by which nodes in the Signal Graph can be created.\n\n  Repeating: calling `reg-sub` does not create a node. It only creates the template\n  from which nodes can be created later.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and it is expected to have the signature:\n    `(input-values, query-vector) -> a-value`\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the `query-vector` argument will be the vector supplied to the\n  the `subscribe` which caused the node to be created. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 \"blue\"])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 \"blue\"]`.\n\n  The arguments supplied between the `query-id` and the `computation-function` can vary in 3 ways,\n  but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part of the template, controlling what input\n values \"flow into\" the `computation function` gets when it is called.\n\n  `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways to define the input signals part.\n  But note, the 2nd method, in which a `signal-fn` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and instructive. The other\n  two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  1. No input signals given:\n      ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `input-fn`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  2.
